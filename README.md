 Advanced Log Analyzer with Dashboard

 Description
This project analyzes application log files and provides insights into system events. It counts log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), generates a CSV summary, and visualizes log distribution with charts. Ideal for monitoring system health and identifying critical issues efficiently.

 Features
- Generate synthetic log dataset (`synthetic_app.log`)  
- Count and summarize logs by level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)  
- Export summary to CSV (`log_summary.csv`)  
- Visualize log levels using bar charts  
- Identify critical events quickly  

 Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming  
- File handling and regex for log parsing  
- Data analysis using `pandas`  
- Data visualization with `matplotlib`  
- Working with synthetic datasets  

 How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed (recommended Python 3.8+).  
2. Install required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
